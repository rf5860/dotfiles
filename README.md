dotfiles
========

All the dot files for my login. 

Files in this directory that start with an '_' will be linked to the equivalent
'.' name in the home directory using the script link.sh

Since private user information is in .gitconfig that information is separated
out into the file "gitconfig.private" which is not in version control. The
contents of that file are in standard .gitconfig file format.
